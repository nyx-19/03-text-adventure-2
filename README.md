# 03-text-adventure
Okay but this is my text adventure game for the Game Tech class I'm in. I decided to make it a type of maze house game where you can explore and look at different rooms. It isn't complex, and there isn't a real ending, just exploring until you feel like you've seen everything there is. 
I added a 'secret' ending, but it's kind of dumb and cheesy. 

Enjoy!
